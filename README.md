## Installation (only powercord)
Open command prompt or whatever, and copy&paste the following command:
```
cd powercord/src/Powercord/themes && git clone https://github.com/ccrashtek/simple-pink-discord
```
after that, just press ctrl+r in your discord

### BetterDiscord:
Open [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ccrashtek/simple-pink-discord/main/BD/ctp.theme.css), press CTRL+S and save file.
Then open your theme folder and drop it there, it should work.
